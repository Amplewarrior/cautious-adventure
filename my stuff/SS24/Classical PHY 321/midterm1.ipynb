    "## Introduction to the first midterm project, total score 100 points\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant reading background is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. chapters 2-5 of Taylor.\n",
    "2. chapters 6-14 of Malthe-Sørenssen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this midterm project we will start with a potential. There are some elements\n",
    "of that exercise which are repeated here, similarly, a good fraction\n",
    "of the codes you have developed for homeworks can be used here.\n",
    "We start with a one-dimensional potential and motion.  Thereafter we\n",
    "extend this potential model for quarks and study the\n",
    "numerical solution of the corresponding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities about midterm projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group, you **must** hand in your own work. **Remember to write your name(s)** and indicate how each person contributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Midterms might cover topics from prior homework, lectures, and readings. It is likely that some of the problems might require a little research on your own or might be slightly beyond what we have done on class and in homework. The midterm is meant to be challenging, but it should also be a good place to learn more about the topics covered in the course. We encourage you to use the textbook, notes, and other resources when solving the midterm. Of course, you can also work with others on the midterm, but make sure you write up the solutions yourself. You can ask the any of the teaching staff for help."

    "In part 2, we are going to study a new potential. This potential contains the basic mathematical components needed to describe the confinement of quarks through a term $\\kappa x$. The aim of this exercise is to try to develop your intuition about the motion of physical objects due to specific forces. Then we will test our intuition by running simulations. The potential, in one dimension only is defined for $x\\in [0.2,\\infty)$.  It reads:\n",

The point $x=2$ is a so-called turning point. Can you find the other turning point where the kinetic energy is zero. If you keep increasing $x$, will the particle ever be able to escape the potential well?\n",

    "4. (20pt) Finally we will now change our program (using either the Euler-Cromer or the Velocity-Verlet method) and compute the position and the velocity as functions of time using the force computed from the above potential. Use as initial condition at time $t=0$ that the particle is $x_0=2$ and has initial velocity $v_0=0$. Test numerically that energy is conserved as function of time. "
