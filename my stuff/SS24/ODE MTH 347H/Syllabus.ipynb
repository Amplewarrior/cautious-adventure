    "<h2><a name=\"Course_Description\"></a>Course Description<strong></strong></h2>\n",
    "<p>This course is an introduction to ordinary differential equations with emphasis on theory. We study different types of differential equations. We start with first order equations, finding formulas for exact solutions of separable equations and linear equations. We study qualitative techniques to understand the behavior of solutions to general first order equations and how to find approximate solutions to equations that cannot be solved exactly. The approximate solution methods include the Euler method and the Picard approximation. We use the Picard approximation to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a wide class of first order nonlinear differential equations.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then, we move to second order linear equations. We find exact formulas for solutions of second order differential equations with constant coefficients, with and without sources. We describe reduction of order methods to get a solution of a second order differential equation is another solution is already known. We also introduce Laplace transform methods to solve constant coefficients equations with generalized source functions including Dirac's delta generalized functions.</p>\n",
    "<p>Later on we study systems of linear differential equations and the graphical representations of their solutions. We introduce systems of first order nonlinear equations, and we show how to obtain qualitative properties of their solutions by studying their linearizations around equilibrium solutions.</p>\n",
    "<p>We then go back to second order scalar equations and provide a brief introduction to boundary value problems, simple Sturm-Liouville type problems, and Fourier Series. Near the end of the course, we combine previous ideas to solve an initial boundary value problem for the heat equation, which is partial differential equation.</p>\n",

According to the University's Grief Absence Policy, it is the responsibility of the student to:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>notify the Associate Dean or designee of their college of the need for a grief absence in a timely manner, but no later than one week from the student’s initial knowledge of the situation,</li>\n",

    "<p>It is the responsibility of the Associate Dean or designee to:</p>\n",

An&nbsp;<strong>Academic Dishonesty Report</strong>&nbsp;describing the type of infraction will be&nbsp;<strong>sent to the Dean of the College</strong>&nbsp;in which the violating student is enrolled. Additional penalties, in accordance with MSU policy, may include the&nbsp;<strong>failure in the course</strong>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<strong>administrative sanction</strong>, which may include&nbsp;<strong>suspension or expulsion from the University</strong>. See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSU Academic Integrity Policies</a>.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Limits of Confidentiality</h3>\n",
    "<p>Essays, journals, and other materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to the University’s student record policies. However, students should be aware that University employees, including instructors, may not be able to maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues to protect the health and safety of MSU community members and others. Instructors&nbsp; must report the following information to the Department of Police and Public Safety if you share it:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Suspected child abuse/neglect, even if this maltreatment happened when you were a child,</li>\n",
    "<li>Allegations of sexual assault or sexual harassment when they involve MSU students, faculty, or staff, and</li>\n",
    "<li>Credible threats of harm to oneself or to others.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>These reports will trigger contact from the Department of Police and Public Safety who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In almost all cases, it will be your decision whether you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting you are encouraged to make an appointment with the MSU Counseling Center.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Disruptive Behavior</h3>\n",
    "<p>Article 2.III.B.4 of the Academic Freedom Report (AFR) for students at Michigan State University states: \"The student's behavior in the classroom shall be conducive to the teaching and learning process for all concerned.\" Article 2.III.B.10 of the AFR states that \"The student has a right to scholarly relationships with faculty based on mutual trust and civility.\" General Student Regulation 5.02 states: \"No student shall . . . interfere with the functions and services of the University (for example, but not limited to, classes . . .) such that the function or service is obstructed or disrupted. Students whose conduct adversely affects the learning environment in this classroom may be subject to disciplinary action through the Student Judicial Affairs office.\"</p>\n",
