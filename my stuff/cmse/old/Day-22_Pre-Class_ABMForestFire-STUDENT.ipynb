    "## More details about agent-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic sense, an agent-based model is one in which there is a universe of _things_ that _do stuff_. For example, when we were modeling the spread of zombies, we originally considered a model in which some fraction of the population were zombies or infected or in some other state. As time passes, the change in the fraction residing in each state varies depending on all the fractions. In an agent-based model, rather than consider fractions, we consider *individual agents*; **that is, we would follow single zombies as they infect other agents.** Agent-based models can thereby capture important spatial relationships that are obscured in other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs are among the most powerful and easy to use computational models. Their ease of use stems from the fact that they are built on **rules**: if you can specify what the rules are in terms of code, it is not necessary to formulate your model directly in terms of equations (which is not always easy to do). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can understand the original motivation of using ABMs by thinking about the term \"agent\". The idea was that there were entities, think of people, companies/markets or governments, that have ideas or opinions that can be influenced by other agents. If we can build into each agent all of its behaviors, we can then allow the agents to interact with each other to see what behaviors emerge. \n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs originated in the field of computational sociology. There were fairly strict definitions of what an agent was; it needed to have these four traits:\n",
    "1. autonomy - ability to act on its own\n",
    "2. social ability - can interact with other agents\n",
    "3. reactivity - reacts to both other agents and the environment\n",
    "4. proactivity - has some sort of belief system; or, has its own goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the term \"ABM\" has nearly lost its meaning because of its wide use (or, perhaps, *mis*use). It would be clunky to account for the complexities of a human in a compartmental model as there are many attributes of a human (eg. age, height, number of friends, politcal beliefs, medical history, etc). But, if we define each agent to be an **individual** person, we can sample from known distributions (e.g., age, height, health status) to assign statistical behavior to that person (e.g., using census data).

    "# Part 2: Modeling a Forest Fire using an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to make our first foray into ABMs by modeling a forest fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why model forest fires?\n",
    "\n",
    "While this isn't a huge problem in Michigan, the _states in the western United States having been suffering a tremendous problem with difficult-to-control forest fires_.  This comes from a combination of extended drought conditions, dense woodlands, and forest management policies that suppress small fires and thus ensure that large quantities of dead, dry trees and brush are available to burn when a large fire inevitably starts.  In recent years, this has been exacerbated by climate change, which has both caused drought conditions to be more severe and allowed tree-killing diseases and insects to flourish, which produces more dead, easily-burned wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forest fires destroy ecosystems and peoples' homes and other property, and can result in the loss of human and animal life.  A key challenge in forest management is to attempt to contain these huge forest fires once they start. To that end, it is critical to have models of how fire spreads in various conditions; see, for example, the [Open Wildland Fire Modeling group](https://wiki.openwfm.org/wiki/Open_Wildland_Fire_Modeling_E_community_Wiki).\n"

You can drag the slider back and forth to change the density.  After you do that, click the \"setup\" button and then click \"go\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do you observe?**  Try setting the \"density\" value to various numbers between 0 and 99, and see how the wildfire spreads.  What happens when the value is low versus when it is high?  Is there any particular value where the behavior changes very rapidly as you change the density of trees?  If so, try to home in on that number and report it below."

In order to do this, we'll need code that's capable of plotting a 2D NumPy array, as well as code that will set up our initial forest and the start of our fire. This is what you'll work on in this pre-class assignment, so that we can work on coding up the rules of the model in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our forest will be represented by a two-dimensional, square array with sides that are N cells long. The cells in the array can have three values: __0 (empty), 1 (trees), and 2 (on fire)__.  At the beginning of the model, a user-specified fraction of the cells $\\mathrm{f_{trees\\_start}}$ (which is equivalent to the NetLogo `density` parameter) are randomly filled with trees, and the remaining cells are empty.  To start out, one edge of the board (say, the entire leftmost column) is set on fire.\n",

Essentially, `meshgrid` takes one-dimensional arrays and creates new multi-dimensional arrays made up of the values from the one dimensional arrays. In the code below, for example, `meshgrid` takes the x and y values and creates two, new 2D arrays with the x and y values filling the arrays. You might need to experiment with meshgrid a bit on your own to understand how it works."

Remember, we want the forest to be an NxN square where __0 is \"empty\", 1 is \"tree\", and 2 is \"fire\".__ The \"density\" of the forest or fraction of the forest initially covered in trees, $f_{tree\\_start}$, should be defined by the probability that a given cell starts off with a tree in it. Start off the board so that the leftmost column of the board is initialized to be \"on fire\"!\n",

Test out your function by plotting your forest array after you create it!\n",
