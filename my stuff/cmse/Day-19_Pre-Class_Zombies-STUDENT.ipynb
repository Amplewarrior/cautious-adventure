The _Zombies_ can come from two sources: the resurrected from the deceased (_Removed_ group) and from _Susceptibles_ who have ‘lost’ an encounter with a zombie.  _Zombies_ reduce upon being defeated.  The _Removed_ group represent dead humans and zombies.  This post-apocalyptic world can be represented graphically as a compartmental model:  \n",

In fact, it turns out that the author of the paper was a bit sloppy with their code and wasn't consistent with the parameters used in their model. Additionally, they didn't use an accurate solver like `solve_ivp` to evolve their system! If you take a look at their code at the end of the paper, you can even see that they made a simplifying assumption in their model that isn't well explained in the paper. This is a good example of how **_not_** to write a high-quality paper. Of course, exploring this model is still valuable and we'll make sure we do it correctly!\n",
