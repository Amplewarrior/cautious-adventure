A list is considered a \"mutable\" Python data type which means that once you create a list, you are free to change the contents of that list. Lists are also handy because they can store pretty much any other type of python variable within them -- including other lists! Creating lists of lists can actually be extremely handy at times. The following table should serve as a simple reference guide for lists. Note that you might have to scroll side to the side to see the whole table."
