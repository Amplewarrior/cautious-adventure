    "## 4. Writing `while` loops in Python (7 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is another fundamental programming concept in many programming languages and another \"control flow\" method. The `while` loop basically tells the computer to execute the code inside the loop until a particlar condition is met. This means that the number of times the loop is executed may not be immediately known because the conditional statement used to determine when to exit the loop is often dependent on the code that is being called inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using a conditional statement to determine when to stop iterating over the loop can be really useful, it can also be **really problematic**. A poorly written `while` loop can result in what is often referred to as an **\"infinite\" or \"endless\" loop**. An infinite loop is a loop that, as you might expect, runs continuously with no end (hence the alternate \"endless\" name). Infinite loops occur when the conditional statement used in the `while` loop never becomes `False`. If the conditional statement is always `True`, then the loop will run forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When using `while` loops in Python, <font color=\"red\">watch out for infinite loops!</font>**. You'll often notice that you've created an infinite loop when you see `In[*]` on the left-hand side of the cell you just executed for longer than expected. Normally, when a cell finishes running, the `*` becomes a number. **Take a look at your code cells above to confirm this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If, in this assignment, you've found that you created an infinite loop, or suspect that you might have, you can \"interrupt\" the notebook and stop the code from trying to run. Then you can fix your error and try again. To interrupt your notebook and stop the cell from running, click on the \"Kernel\" tab at the top of your notebook and select \"Interrupt\" or, simply click on the &#9632; at the top of the notebook."

    "\n",
    "Conditional statements that are used outside of `while` loops in Python, often referred to as \"`if`\" statements, are a really useful way to control the flow of your code so that certain pieces of code are only executed when specific conditions are met (hence the term \"conditional\"). Getting used to using `if` statements, and more complex `if`-`else` or `if`-`elif`-`else` statements, is an important part of learning to build evermore complex algorithms.\n",

    "One of the most challenging aspects of writing `if` statements is just thinking through the logic of what the right conditions are to get the code to do what you want.
