Once it finished, review you notebook and make sure there weren't any errors that popped up. Sometimes, when working with notebooks, we accidentally change code in one cell that break our code in another cell. If your TA stumbles across code cells that don't work, **they will likely have to give you a zero for those portions of the notebook that don't work**. Testing your notebook one last time is a good way to make sure this doesn't happen.\n",
